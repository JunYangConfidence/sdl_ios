/// Manages presenting and dismissing the lock screen based on several settings:
/// 1. The lock screen configuration set by the developer. If the set to the default configuration, the lock screen manager will show or hide the lockscreen based on the the current `hmiLevel` of the SDL app and the current driver distraction (DD) status. However, the developer can also set the lockscreen to always show or not show at all.
/// 2. Whether the passenger has dismissed the lockscreen (RPC v.6.0+). Once the passenger has dismissed the lockscreen, it will not be shown again during the same session.
